With Sendbird Live SDK, you can integrate live streaming functionality where users can host and participate in live events. In a live event, hosts can communicate with real-time voice and video while participants can engage in a live event by using chat, which is powered by open channels from Sendbird Chat. 

For more information about the SDK, please refer to our [API Reference](https://sendbird.com/docs/live/v1/ios/ref/index.html).
