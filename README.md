> **Warning**
> Since CocoaPods doesn't maintain their service, we can't upload Live SDK to CocoaPods. Please use SPM instead CocoaPods. 

With Sendbird Live SDK, you can integrate live streaming functionality where users can host and participate in live events. In a live event, hosts can communicate with real-time voice and video while participants can engage in a live event by using chat, which is powered by open channels from Sendbird Chat. 

For more information about the SDK, please refer to our [API Reference](https://sendbird.com/docs/live/v1/ios/ref/index.html).
